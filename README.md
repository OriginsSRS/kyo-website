# Origins Scientific Research Society

> Rated S for Science!

**Origins Scientific Research Society** is an #OpenScience initiative which promotes the growth of scientific research by students and non-traditional learners via a free portal of science journals. The organization strives to make science freely available by publishing research and making data available to the public.

OSRS is a one-stop internet destination to access scientific knowledge in the form of text, images, videos, and other interactive multimedia in a free, open format which can be shared and remixed by anyone in the community. OSRS serves as a portal for anyone passionate about science to contribute and collect information for their own research. OSRS is part of the open science movement. We leverage Creative Commons and MIT licensing to bring and publish new freely available content to our science fans.

## About the Template

Say hello to Story, a brand new responsive one-pager for HTML5 UP! Inspired by my work
on Carrd*, Story is built to be extremely modular and tweakable, and as such is entirely
built on reusable, insanely customizable elements (like "spotlight" and "gallery") that
can be endlessly duplicated and tweaked into whatever you need to tell your story --
without, in many cases, touching *any* CSS. Check out index-demo.html for an interactive
demo, and index.html for the actual template. Enjoy!
